        <h3><img src="./images/sun-removebg-preview (1).png" alt="Sun" width="40" text-color="white"> Sun</h3>
        <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive ball of hydrogen and helium that generates light and heat through nuclear fusion. Its energy is crucial for life on Earth.</p>
    </dt>

    <dt>
        <h3><img src="./images/MercuryCGIpromo.GIF.webp" alt="mercury" width="25"> Mercury</h3>
        <p>Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun. Due to its thin atmosphere, it experiences extreme temperature variations. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury has ice at its poles, hidden in deep craters.</p>
    </dt>

    <dt>
        <h3> <img src="./images/images-removebg-preview.png" alt="venus" width="28"> Venus</h3>
        <p>Venus is similar in size to Earth but vastly different in other ways. Its thick atmosphere traps heat, making it the hottest planet in the solar system. Its surface is covered with volcanoes and sulfuric acid clouds.</p>
    </dt>

    <dt>
        <h3><img src="./images/earth-removebg-preview.png" alt="Earth" width="27"> Earth</h3>
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. Its atmosphere contains the right mixture of gases to sustain life, and it has abundant liquid water, which is essential for life.</p>
    </dt>

    <dt>
        <h3><img src="./images/mars-removebg-preview.png" alt="Mars" width="30">Mars</h3>
        <p>Mars, often called the Red Planet, has the largest volcano and canyon in the solar system. Its surface is rocky with evidence of ancient rivers and lakes. Mars is a key target in the search for signs of past life.</p>
    </dt>

    <dt>
        <h3><img src="./images/jupiter-removebg-preview.png" alt="Jupiter" width="29"> Jupiter</h3>
        <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System, a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. Its Great Red Spot is a giant storm that has been raging for centuries. Jupiter also has faint rings and many moons.</p>
    </dt>

    <dt>
        <h3><img src="./images/saturn-removebg-preview.png" alt="saturn" width="29"> Saturn</h3>
        <p>Saturn is well known for its stunning ring system made of ice and rock. It is a gas giant like Jupiter and has dozens of moons, including Titan, which has a thick atmosphere and liquid methane lakes.</p>
    </dt>

    <dt>
        <h3><img src="./images/uranus-removebg-preview (1).png" alt="uranus" width="35"> Uranus</h3>
        <p>Uranus is unique because it rotates on its side, making its seasons extreme. It has a pale blue color due to the methane in its atmosphere and is an ice giant with a cold and windy atmosphere.</p>
    </dt>

    <dt>
        <h3><img src="./images/neptune-removebg-preview.png" alt="neptune" width="29"> Neptune</h3>
        <p>Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun and is known for its deep blue color and strong winds. Like Uranus, it is an ice giant, and its atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium, and methane. Neptune also has faint rings.</p>
